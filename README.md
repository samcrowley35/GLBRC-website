Website for the GLBRC software engineer position

- Pages needed: login page, home page (links need to be able to be arranged), manage links page (contains non-default pages with an add and remove option)

- Need a database to hold the user data and the link data

- Need a dockerfile to get it up and running.

- This README needs to have instructions on how to run and build the website
